=== Import Already Deployed Smart Contract
Imports already deployed smart contract for the specified contract address. Parameters `contract_id`, `redirect_url`,
`arbitrary_data`, `screen_config` and all its child fields are optional. `arbitrary_data` field can contain any desired
JSON value. Contract import request ID can be interpolated into the `redirect_url` by placing `${id}` placeholder in
the place where request ID is desired in the URL. The placeholder must strictly have dollar sign and brackets to be
interpolated, and only `id` field can be interpolated.

If `contract_id` field is not provided, then contract binary de-compilation will be attempted in order to generate a
contract decorator for the imported contract.

*This request requires an API key present in the `X-API-KEY` header.*
