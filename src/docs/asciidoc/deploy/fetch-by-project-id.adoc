|Parameter |Description

|`contractIds`
|Comma separated list of contract IDs to filter by. Each list element act as an `OR` operator.

|`contractTags`
|Comma separated list of contract tags to filter by. Individual elements can contain multiple contract tags separated by
`AND` to specify that contract must contain all of those tags, while individual list elements act as `OR` operator.

*Example:* `contractTags=tag-1,tag-2` will fetch all contracts with either `tag-1` or `tag-2`, while
`contractTags=tag-1 AND tag-2,tag-3` will fetch all contracts with both `tag-1` and `tag-2`, or with at least `tag-3`.

|`contractImplements`
|Comma separated list of implemented contract traits to filter by. Individual elements can contain multiple implemented
contract traits separated by `AND` to specify that contract must contain all of those tags, while individual list
elements act as `OR` operator.

|`deployedOnly`
|If set to `true`, only deployed contracts (with `status` equal to `SUCCESS` and non-null `contractAddress`) will be
fetched.
