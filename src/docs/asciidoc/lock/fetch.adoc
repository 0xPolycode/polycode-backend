=== Fetch ERC20 Lock Request by ID
Fetches stored ERC20 lock request with its current status. The request is considered successful if the attached
transaction is confirmed on blockchain and all its data matches specified request parameters (correct `to` and `from`
addresses, `amount`, matching `data` and `tx_hash`). If there are any mismatches between specified request data and
state on blockchain, the request will be marked as failed. If there is no attached transaction hash or if transaction
for attached hash is not yet mined on blockchain, request will be in pending state.
