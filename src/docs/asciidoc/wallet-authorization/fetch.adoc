=== Fetch Wallet Authorization Request by ID
Fetches stored wallet authorization request with its current status. The request is considered successful if the
attached signed message is valid and was signed by `wallet_address`. If `wallet_address` was not specified when the
request was created, then any valid signature will be accepted. For pending requests, `signed_message` field will always
be `null`. If the signed message is invalid or does not match specified `wallet_address`, request will be considered as
failed. If the request was crated with `store_indefinitely` field set to `false`, the the request will be deleted after
the first time it is fetched by ID.
