=== Create Contract Function Call Request
Creates contract function call request with specified parameters. Parameters `redirect_url`, `caller_address`,
`arbitrary_data`, `screen_config` and all its child fields are optional. `arbitrary_data` field can contain any desired
JSON value. Contract function call request ID can be interpolated into the `redirect_url` by placing `${id}` placeholder
in the place where request ID is desired in the URL. The placeholder must strictly have dollar sign and brackets to be
interpolated, and only `id` field can be interpolated.

Target contract can be specified by providing `deployed_contract_id`, `deployed_contract_alias` or `contract_address` in
the request body. Exactly one of the mentioned values must be provided, otherwise the request will be considered
invalid. The `deployed_contract_id` and `deployed_contract_alias` correspond to ID or alias of the contract which was
deployed using the <<Contract Deployment Request API>>. If `contract_address` is used to specify target contract, then
`deployed_contract_id` will have `null` value in the response.

The `functionParams` field is an array of objects which must have `type` and `value` according to the table in
section <<Available Function Argument Types>>.

*This request requires an API key present in the `X-API-KEY` header.*
