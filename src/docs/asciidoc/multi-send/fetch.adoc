=== Fetch Asset Multi-Send Request by ID
Fetches stored asset multi-send request with its current status.

For token transfers, the request is considered successful if the attached approve and disperse transactions are
confirmed on blockchain and all their data matches specified request parameters (correct `to` and `from` addresses,
`amount`, matching `data` and `tx_hash`). If there are any mismatches between specified request data and state on
blockchain, the request will be marked as failed. If there are no attached transaction hashes or if approve or disperse
transactions for attached hashes are not yet mined on blockchain, request will be in pending state.

If `approve_status` is `FAILED` or `PENDING` for token transfer request, then `disperse_status` and `disperse_tx` will
be `null` until `approve_status` changes to `SUCCESS`.

For native token transfers, only disperse transaction is considered when determining request status (both
`approve_status` and `approve_tx` fields will be `null`).
