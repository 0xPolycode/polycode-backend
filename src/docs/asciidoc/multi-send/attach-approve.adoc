=== Attach Approve Transaction Info to Asset Multi-Send Request
Attaches approve transaction hash and caller wallet address to existing asset multi-send request. Once the approve
transaction hash is attached to the request, any subsequent attempts to attach a new approve transaction hash will fail.
Only token transfers require an approve transaction, for native asset this step is skipped.
