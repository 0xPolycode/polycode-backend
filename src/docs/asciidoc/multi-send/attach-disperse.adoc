=== Attach Disperse Transaction Info to Asset Multi-Send Request
Attaches disperse transaction hash and caller wallet address to existing asset multi-send request. Once the disperse
transaction hash is attached to the request, any subsequent attempts to attach a new approve transaction hash will fail.
For token transfers, disperse transaction info must be attached after the approve transaction has been successful and
its info has been attached to the request. For native asset transfers, only disperse transaction info must be attached.
